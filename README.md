## üõ†Ô∏è **Data Cleaning Process**

The dataset was cleaned to ensure consistent, reliable, and actionable insights. Below are the steps undertaken:

---

### **1. Handling Missing Values**
- Columns with missing values such as `budget`, `revenue`, and `runtime` were either:
  - Imputed with appropriate values.
  - Dropped if they contained excessive missing data.
  
**Reasoning:** Missing values in critical columns could skew analysis.

---

### **2. Dropping Duplicates**
- Identified duplicate rows using the `title`, `release_date`, and `id` columns.
- Removed duplicate entries from the dataset.

**Reasoning:** Retaining duplicates could result in inflated metrics like revenue or popularity.

---

### **3. Parsing and Splitting Nested Data**
- Columns such as `genres`, `production_countries`, and `spoken_languages` contained comma-separated values.
- Split these strings and exploded them for granular analysis.

**Example:**
| **Original**                 | **Cleaned**       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| `Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi`     | Separate rows for `Action`, `Adventure`, and `Sci-Fi` |

---

### **4. Calculating Additional Metrics**
- Added a derived column:  
  `profit_musd = revenue_musd - budget_musd`

**Reasoning:** This metric helps measure a movie's financial success beyond just revenue.

---

### **5. Normalizing Currency Values**
- Standardized `revenue` and `budget` values to millions of USD:
  - `revenue_musd`
  - `budget_musd`

**Reasoning:** Simplifies comparisons across movies with vastly different financial scales.

---

### **6. Formatting Dates**
- Converted the `release_date` column to a standard datetime format.
- Created new columns for:
  - `release_year`
  - `release_month`

**Reasoning:** Facilitates temporal analysis like movie releases by year or month.

---

### **7. Removing Ambiguous or Non-Informative Rows**
- Excluded entries with `Unknown` values in `genres` or `production_countries`.
- Dropped movies with `revenue_musd` or `budget_musd` of 0 if no imputation was feasible.

**Reasoning:** Ensures the data reflects meaningful and accurate information.

This cleaning process guarantees a high-quality dataset suitable for generating actionable insights and accurate visualizations.
